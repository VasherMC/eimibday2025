You blew up a school, built a chair, became Elden Lord, got a lobotomy.. y'know typical hamster antics. You even became a senpa- I mean a mom! But more than anything last year hits home why I couldn't see having anyone else as my oshi, you’re truly one of a kind. What might start as a simple drawing stream or zatsu will somehow turn into labbing another bit about jorkin it or watching videos on dinosaur themed love hotels. You can never really predict how an Eimi stream is gonna go and it just keeps me coming back for more. And on top of that you’ve formed a great community filled with so many kind, eccentric, and accepting people and it's all thanks to you. All of your hard work and talent as a streamer, singer, artist and as our boss make you truly special (and I mean that both ways) to all of us and I hope you know that.</p><p>Happy Birthday Boss, Keep on being you. - LabMem#6400</p>",

Pretty sure you've also heard all about how great the labhams have been as a little community of dumb stupid morons. They even care about all the dumb niche references and walls of texts I force upon them like twice or three times a week. I mean it works both ways tbh, I would never have cared about the umas or the 100 lines if it wasn't for the gangle of morons I love hanging around with and the big kahuna we all worship like insane people.

My first real stream I watched of you I forgot what we were talking about but what I thought was funny was you saying gang (&#x26; something along the lines or twin/opp or jit💀)in normal conversation. I always think it's funny, the juxtaposition of \"silly cute anime girls\" using gen Z/East/West Coast ebonic slang like there from the trenches💀and it was relatable to me coming from a \"lower-middle class neighborhood\", I never really saw that before watching a Vtuber, usually it's just me or my friends or people in different type of circles that talk like that that maybe aren't into Vtubing and that was nice to see for once. What I'm trying to say is I think you're relatable and genuinely funny and interesting to engage with and talk to on stream. I honestly wish I found you sooner but I think everything happens for a reason☝️, and interacting with your community n yourself has been enriching to my life and I hope that I can enrich theirs and yours in the long run I want to be a part of this community more and do more things in it. You're truly one of a kind with what you say and how you portray yourself, I hope you have many more birthdays growing and being yourself only good can come of it, and I will be supporting it. You and your buddies at phase have consumed my life mostly for the better and I wouldn't have it any other way happy birthday Eimi Isami❤️🐹<br></p>",

The times I got the chance to watch your streams, whether I was glued to the screen and typing in chat or having you as 2nd monitor/BG noise, I was soooooo cheesed :33. From your silly moments to the crashouts, I genuinely loved it all. Your eccentric and creative personality carries the stream (along with chat) as I'm slapping my bellay and calling myself a chud. I wished I tuned to more of your streams but didn't/couldn't cos either work got busy, was doing something else, or was planning to play said game (in the future) you were streaming and didn't want to get spoiled. Speaking of games. Thanks to you and the hams, I've added plenty of VNs, and games that you've streamed, that I'd never considered playing into my backlog. I'm honestly happy to be part of the Labhams community, y'all have made 2025 a fun year when it felt a bit gloomy.

    "text": "<p>Eimi came to me at a time in my life where I had been isolated after being bullied out of my friend group. My schizophrenia was so bad that I stopped using social media and only watched Youtube because it was the only thing people couldn't see my activity on. I had almost no friends left and spent most of the day immobile convinced people were tracking my phone's movement. I didn't even play Final Fantasy because I was afraid they would come find me in game and harass me. Eimi was companionship in someone I felt was just like me when I had no social stimulation.</p><p>After discovering Eimi, my life changed a lot. I became corpo. I stopped having time to be in streams. In these two years, I moved twice, I held my still baby (🐈 ) in the hospital, my apartment flooded, I got mold poisoning, my corpo exploded.. I've lost count of how many things have been added to the concoction of PTSD that has paralyzed me. To say I'm doing bad is an understatement. You don't realize how awful it's been until you say it out loud all together.</p><p>I am still standing anyways, but so is Eimi. In a world where I feel like a strange and disgusting beast unlike every other, Eimi stands tall with everyone else while being just like me. She streams what she wants, sleeps all day, and fucks around, and she still gets to stand up there. It stood as a sign that someone like me could do it. And I did do it. I knew I could, because she could. Even through every hell I have lived through both during my time as a corpo and now, and through everything Eimi has lived, the both of us have stayed regardless.</p><p>2026 is projected to be better, according to the THE PROPHECY (Trust Me). It's supposed to look up a lot. I have my hopes on what this means for me, but at this point in time, I just pray it means I can live without fear and get out of bed. I still gotta stream, cuz Eimi streams all the time and that's crazy. If Eimi can do it, so can I, and so must I. So for 2026, I have to just keep running. My journey has felt like I'm running as fast as I can to try to meet a blinding light that is suspiciously hamster shaped. No matter how close, I will never feel that I've touched it, so I just have to keep running. I don't know if I ever will touch it, but I think maybe it's better off that way, so that it compels me to run forever.</p><p>Maybe this year I will finally be able to make you a birthday present, but I find myself pushed to the brink with a drained body today. One day I will make something. If I'm really lucky, maybe that will be tomorrow. In the meantime, I am spending my birthday at the mall with my best friend, the same way I spent it the first ever day I learned I'd be becoming corpo, January 8th, 2024.</p><p>How lucky I am to be born so close to someone like this. How odd, it feels, to look up to someone so much like me, the me I've admonished for its endless faults.</p><p>I hope the birthday merch this year has eimi cocaine lets all smoke crack and die</p><p><strong>Knelli Cifarelli</strong></p>",

Thanks to you and the wonderful, inviting space you have created I managed to make friends, reach out to others, and come out of the ol' shell. Hell, the 2 out of the 3 times I have flown have been to bug you and the Euphoria girls live at cons.</p><p>It is always fun to watch and fall to sleep to your left-clicking adventures, send a colored box or two to bully you, and as opposed to most, you bully back. You understand bantz, and I respect that. Also thanks to you I managed to pick up singing. I have really improved and performed some to small crowds, so thank you for growing my horizons even further (I would show the video, but the audio is quiet). I can't wait for next year's barrel of fun, and Phasecon is looking to be nuts. My brother is already talking about bringing and pissing in a ball pit.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Solid Skelie</p>",

As your self proclaimed most washed labham I got off my bum ass and started and...actually worked on something? truth be told i'm going to AnimeLa this weekend so irl shit has gotten in my way, i'll finish it when i get back i pinky promise so if you found this even FIVE percent as funny as I did laughing my ass off drawing it please just gimme a little more time. PRETTY PLEASE atleast wait for me to get home before you sent the hams to slime me 😭😭😭 I don't want my stupid little chudham life to end when my body hits the concrete in fucking long beach california.<br>My goofy ass aside, happy fucking birthday man, to be a little more sincere I look up to you in a lotta ways boss. I fw your art heavy, your music heavy, and you're simply very funny and clever and seeing you deny it every time its brought up makes me laugh. <br>Because I want to develop my bullshit patchwork of skills into being even half as good as you and actually start making stuff. Additionally it makes me think about how often I do that whenever i got even a hint of a compliment. SO my bitchass doesn't have any room to be \"humble\" just yet. Your goated twin and i'm gonna be so very cheesed to see what you do next no matter what it is.<br>On a final very personal note, your skills aside I just like you man ^-^. You remind me of some friends I wish I talked to more often so I really can't help but want to root for ya. ts was written at 6 am not having slept so if you didn't read this rambling ass text and just laughed at SatoRika Muyu Eimi thats completely chill.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>John Napling :EimiLOCKIN:</p>",

The more I watched you the fonder I grew of you. Your drawing streams are so much fun, you inspire me in my own art as well. And you were so supportive of me and all the stupid stuff I did. And then you did the 3D stream, and I fell for you so hard. You were just so, so, so cute. And you were so caring of me on my birthday, you checked up on me. At that moment you weren't funny, or creative, or witty, or whimsical, you were just kind. I felt loved, and I had the best birthday of my life, I was the happiest I had ever been. I'm truly happy I found you, and can call you my oshi.<br><br>Love da hampter. Thank you for making my every day brighter. I want to make you smile the same way you make me smile.

Even though I haven't been here for long, I've really come to enjoy my time with your streams and talking with the rest of the labhams. Whether it's playing games on stream, or releasing music, it's easy to tell you put a lot of work into your content. Your singing voice is truly special and your range truly made covers like Spoken For and \" Marshmallow\" shine letting me listen to them over and over. Looking forward to whatever you put.out in the future . Here's to another wonderful year with you boss ham.</p>",
